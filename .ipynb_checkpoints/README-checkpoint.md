# Overview of Project

## Motivation

Bank lenders face high volumes of loan approval requests every day and need a streamlined way to process them. We wanted to explore the possibility of using machine learning to automate loan approval request handling. To do so, we used a synthetic loan dataset and experimented with a few different models and techniques (K Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, L1 Regularization, etc.). 

## Insights from Exploratory Data Analysis

Through our exploratory data analysis, we noticed some correlations between age, credit score, and debt with the likelihood of getting a loan approved. 

## Analysis

In our experimentation with machine learning models, we used a 99/1 train-test split since we had 1,000,000 datapoints. The models we used had similar testing performance (~87%).

To reproduce our results, please open the Binder below and run the cells in the notebooks for Parts 1-3 (in order).
